                Hi, I&apos;m Eskil K. Hagen, a passionate web developer and user
                interface designer. Since 2019, I&apos;ve been diving deep into
                the world of technology, learning and implementing various tools
                and frameworks to create functional and beautiful web
                applications.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg opacity-80 leading-relaxed max-w-xl lg:max-w-2xl">
                My journey started with an interest in technology, and over the
                years, I&apos;ve honed my skills in fullstack development,
                focusing on accessibility, user experience, and modern design
                principles. I believe in the power of clean, simple, and
                efficient design to enhance the user experience.
